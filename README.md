# Employees Tracked

This command-line application within Node works with mySql in order to provide and incorporate user information into the department database.

## Description

The goal of this application is to provide a user with the ability to view data within Node that is queried and stored within a mySQL database. Overall, this will enhance the users ability to upload and modify existing employees or add new employees to the system.

## Problem

There is no way for the Manager to track the employees and add in new employees based off of their role within the organization.

## Solution

Create a command-line application that renders employee and management data that can be dynamically updated via the command line after a user has been prompted for their input.

## User Story

Aa a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company.
With the goal of organizing and updated roles/ add new employees as their careers progress.

## Experience and Learning Opportunities

- This experience overall was a challenge and enhanced my ability to grow as a junior developer. Following the logic and understanding the data was critical in being able to formulate my pseudo code. I also was able to learn the value of following documentation to not break code and keep my eye on the big picture.
